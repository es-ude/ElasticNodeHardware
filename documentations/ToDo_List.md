#ToDo_List

ElasticNode V3

- [ ] check all the capacitorsâ€˜ value

- [ ] capacitors for Decoupling(data collecting finished)



- [ ] capacitors for DC_DC Circuits
  - [ ] how to set the output through LTC3419 



- [ ] check the supply voltage of the FPGA 3.3V 1.0V 1.8V
- [ ] the FPGA needs 3.3V 1.0V and 1.8V
- [ ] we also need 1.5V for GPIO???





- [ ] set the interface between FPGA and MCU



- [ ] set the interface between FPGA and Flash chip

- [ ] set the interface between MCU and Flash chip

- [ ] current measurement chips

- [x] 100% sure, we can use only one SPI on **AT90USB128**, otherwise we have to run USART in SPI mode.

  

- [x] 100M clock signal
- [ ] header for connecting the Mother Board(IIC)
